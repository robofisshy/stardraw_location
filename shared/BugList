      The function ---Notify_sendEvent return a value -1.
      I look up some data, and modify the code.
      Modify the struct _Server in server.c,change it from 
	struct _Server {
    		SyslinkService *service;
	};	to 	struct _Server {
    					SyslinkService *service;
    					ResourceSync *sync;
					};
      And then when the program go into the resource_sync_pair_wait(),
      The function Notify_sendEvent() run successfully.
      But I don't know where is different between the two program, when we 
      init a ResourceSync* independently,it can not work.I just record it here,
      wish I will figure it lately.
